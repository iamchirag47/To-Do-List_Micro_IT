# To-Do-List_Micro_IT
A modern, minimalistic To-Do List desktop application built using Python and CustomTkinter. This project allows users to add, edit, complete, and delete daily tasks through a clean and intuitive user interface. Designed as a part of my portfolio for Micro IT, this project demonstrates my skills in Python GUI development and user-centric design.
